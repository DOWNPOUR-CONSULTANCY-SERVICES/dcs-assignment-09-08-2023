Internship Assignment: Building a Secure User Authentication System
The following task will determine whether or not you are selected for the internship:
In this assignment, you have to create a robust user authentication system that ensures the
security and privacy of user information.
The frontend of the assignment, developed in Next.js, is already completed and available on the
main branch of the Git repository. Your task will be to develop the backend using Express.js to
enable secure user registration, login, and social media authentication through the Google and
Facebook APIs.
To enhance the user experience, you'll implement OTP verification through the Gupshup OTP
service, ensuring seamless and secure authentication. The dashboard you create will showcase
user profiles, complete with their names, email addresses, and phone numbers. A logout feature
will also be implemented for enhanced user control.
As part of best practices, we require you to follow the Git version control workflow. When
submitting your completed code, please create a separate branch in the public repository you
set up for this assignment. You can name the branch, such as "intern-yourname". This practice
helps keep the main branch clean and allows us to easily review and provide feedback on your
work.
As an exciting opportunity for extra recognition, you have the option to host your completed
assignment on Google Cloud services. If you choose to do so, you'll earn extra points in the
assignment evaluation. This optional step will showcase your deployment skills and provide you
with a real-world experience of deploying web applications in a cloud environment.
By successfully completing this assignment, we'll be able to evaluate your hands-on experience
with modern web development frameworks, user authentication techniques, database
integration, and cloud deployment.
We encourage you to submit your completed code to a public repository, in the separate branch
you create, where we can assess your skills and provide feedback.
